<!-- 							<p class="paragraph2" style="padding-top:15px;">Tucker is a sustainable womenâ€™s lifestyle brand with a focus on easy, wearable silhouettes in beautifully printed silk - offered in ever changing colors and patterns. Tucker is driven and inspired by the ability to evoke emotion in the wearer; the brand strives to bring beauty and happiness to those who wear them.</p>
	                        <p class="paragraph2" style="padding-top:15px;">Designed in New York and made in our own factories in the Dominican Republic, every piece is digitally printed and made to order - cutting out waste and over-production. Digital printing eliminates excess ink and uses a fraction of the water required by traditional fabric manufacturing processes.</p>
                      <p class="paragraph2" style="padding-top:15px;">Tucker was founded in 2006 by <a href="/pages/gaby-basora">Gaby Basora</a>.</p> -->
